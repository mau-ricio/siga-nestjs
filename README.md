SaaS Boilerplate with Multitenancy (NestJS + TypeORM)

This boilerplate is a solid starting point for building SaaS applications with full multitenancy support, clean architecture, and modern development practices using Node.js and NestJS.

🧬 Purpose

Scalably address the challenge of managing multiple clients (tenants) in a SaaS platform, offering flexibility for:

Tenants sharing or having dedicated databases

Centralized tenant and database management through an admin area

Strong data isolation and secure tenant authentication

🚀 Key Features

True Multitenancy, with:

Isolated Admin Database (admin.sqlite, PostgreSQL, or any TypeORM-compatible DB)

Multiple operational databases (shared or dedicated)

Tenant-aware entities via tenantId column, ensuring full compatibility with any DB (no schemas used)

Separate Admin Area, with:

Independent login (AdminUsers)

Management of tenants and available databases

Tenant-level authentication using JWT

Automatic tenant injection on each request with enforced isolation

Modern and organized architecture:

Clean Architecture + SOLID + DRY principles

Dependency injection via NestJS

Fully documented APIs with Swagger (interactive and testable)

📁 Project Structure

Organized by domain:

src/
├── admin/                # AdminUsers, Tenants, and Databases
├── auth/                 # Authentication for Admin and Tenant
├── tenant-aware/         # Operational features (Users etc.)
├── shared/               # Middlewares, decorators, base services, interceptors
├── config/               # Configuration module
└── main.ts               # Application bootstrap

🛠️ Tech Stack

Node.js + NestJS

TypeORM ORM

PostgreSQL for production / SQLite for development

JWT for authentication

Swagger for interactive API documentation

🚧 How Multitenancy Works

Admin registers a database (shared or dedicated).

A new tenant is created and linked to one of the available databases.

During login, the tenant's slug identifies the DB and generates a JWT.

All subsequent requests automatically inject the correct tenantId into controllers/services.

"Tenant-aware" entities use tenantId for access filtering.
